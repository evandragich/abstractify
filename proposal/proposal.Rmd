title: "The Alphas Project #2 Proposal"
output: html_document

# Project Goal 
We intend to create a Shiny Application wherein the user inputs an image and 
the application outputs a simplified version of this image as well as a custom 
color palette based on the image which can then be used in ggplot visualizations 
and/or in a paint by numbers. 

# Project Motivation and Focus 
We’ve been inspired to create this application by the prospect of automating the 
“paint-by-numbers” (PBN) process. Limitations in current R packages make the 
prospect of generating blank, uncolored PBN templates untenable, but we instead 
intend to take an image, bin its most common colors, then return it with a 
simplified color palette. Further, we’ll show some simple visualizations to 
break down the frequency of colors in the modified image.  Additionally, we 
will return the outlines of the image without color for possible printing 
purposes.

We’ve chosen to organize our project repository in a similar manner to our first 
project - the data and proposal have been given their own folders and the main 
project rmd will be left at the top level of the project. Within our data folder,
we’ll store the images that we use to test our app, but the final product should 
obtain all of its images from user input. 


# Weekly Plan Outline 
Week of 11/8: all 4 team members will go through peer review of the proposal and 
make any necessary edits to the project/proposal. Resubmit if necessary. Margaret 
can perfect the function that draws the boundaries of the colors. Evan will 
ensure that the imager package is the appropriate package to use for simplifying 
the image. Emely and Andrew will explore the features of the colordistance package 
and aid other team members where necessary.

Week of 11/15: The basic part of the project should be solidified at this point 
(ie: drawing boundaries, extracting color, etc) At this point we can start 
working on the Shiny app which will be the user’s interface for uploading their 
image. All 4 team members should contribute to this. Simultaneously, we should 
explore the other facets of the project and see which of the ideas we came up 
with is going to be the most feasible and interesting. 

Week of 11/22: Continue developing the shiny app, incorporate the aspects of the 
project that we decide on the previous week (ie: interactive paint by numbers, 
the different visualizations, etc). Begin presentation slides and write up. Emely
and Margaret will take the lead on the write up and Andrew and Evan will work on 
the presentation slides. 

Week of 11/29: Finalize all aspects of the shiny app and project in general. Have
other people test out the shiny app to ensure it is working and user friendly.
