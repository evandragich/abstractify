# Abstract-ify
## The Alphas: STA 313 Fall 2021

# Introduction 
We have created a shiny app which takes two user inputs: their own image and the 
number of colors they would like in their "abstract-ified" image. The app then 
gives the user a variety of outputs based on their image such as the abstract 
image, the image outline, a custom color palette which they can then download and 
use in their own ggplots, and finally they can see the color palette used in sample 
ggplots which utilize the bachelor degrees, dog adoption, and brexit data sets.

# Repo Organization 
Data folder contains the sample images, proposal folder contains our initial 
project idea, the scripts folder contains the outline function we created which 
finds the color boundaries in the user's image and creates an image outline.
